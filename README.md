Our Official Website for Simplifying Southern
-IMPORTANT- 
This website is a website being made for fun. (If any) Credit Card/Debit Card forms and or log-in/sign-up forms are just a joke and we do not actually ever see this data
Actually I don't think github would work for those because it only allows STATIC websites meaning there are no ".php"s with are used for login forms and CC/DC Forms
If you have any problems with this website please email us at "aeroliteco@gmail.com" Simplifying Southern is just a website for coding and 6th Grade Math Class website.
Everything on this website can be accessed by the general public however there is no search bar for URLs and or endings. If you want a directory of all the files go 
to "/dir" and you will get a directory of all the files.
